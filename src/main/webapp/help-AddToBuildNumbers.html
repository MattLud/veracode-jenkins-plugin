    The value of this field should be an integer.  It is added to the hudson build number to determine the build number
    to use in the Veracode API calls.  Once a build number for a given app has been  used it can't be used again through
    the API, this could prove problematic if you are constantly reconfiguring your build which would cause the build number
    generated by Hudson/Jenkins to start over from 1.  This allows you to set a starting value in essence that is higher
    than your previously configured build got to.
